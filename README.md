.NET Code Challenge for Senior Developers
Problem Statement:
Design and implement a web application for a blog system where users can create, read,
update, and delete blog posts. The system should provide efficient data storage and retrieval
using Redis for caching and SQL Server for persistent storage. Additionally, ensure the system is
scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
Requirements:
1. Data Model:
o Each blog post preferred to have :
▪ Id: Unique identifier of the blog post.
▪ Title: Title of the blog post.
▪ Content: Content of the blog post.
▪ AuthorId: Identifier of the author of the blog post.
o Each user preferred to have:
▪ Id: Unique identifier of the user.
▪ Name: Name of the user.
2. Redis Caching:
o Implement caching of blog posts using Redis to improve data retrieval
performance.
3. SQL Server Database:
o Use SQL Server to store user and blog post data persistently.
o Design an efficient database schema to store and retrieve blog posts and user
information.
4. Concurrency:
o Implement concurrency handling mechanisms to prevent race conditions and
ensure data consistency.
o Use appropriate locking mechanisms or optimistic concurrency control
strategies.
5. Architecture and Design Patterns:
o Design a scalable and maintainable architecture for the application.
o Utilize a layered architecture (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to
separate concerns and promote modularity.
o Apply appropriate design patterns (e.g., Repository pattern, Unit of Work
pattern) to encapsulate data access logic and promote code reuse.
6. Code Quality:
o Write clean, readable, and well-organized code with proper documentation and
comments.
o Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical functionality and
improve code reliability.
